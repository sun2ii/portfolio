## Overview

This portfolio presents a structured approach to enterprise AI integration — from discovery through architecture design to implementation planning. Each document demonstrates how complex business operations are translated into scalable, AI-ready systems.

**Focus areas:** Workflow mapping, operational redesign, data modeling, RAG systems, embeddings, knowledge architecture

**Industries:** Insurance, logistics, contractors, infrastructure operations, compliance-heavy environments

## Portfolio Contents

### 01. Engagement Philosophy
**[01-engagement-philosophy.md](01-engagement-philosophy.md)**

My approach to enterprise AI: clarity-first architecture, current-state mapping, strategic AI integration only where operationally justified.

**Key concepts:**
- Map reality before automating
- Simple, auditable, operationally grounded systems
- Rules-based vs. AI-based decision framework

---

### 02. Selected Work Examples
**[02-selected-work-examples.md](02-selected-work-examples.md)**

Case studies demonstrating end-to-end AI architecture across three domains:
- **MyFencer** — AI knowledge + workflow automation for contractors
- **XOPS** — Enterprise embeddings + release automation
- **LouCanette** — Backend inventory + pricing architecture

---

### 03. 90-Day AI Discovery & Architecture Process (Generic)
**[03-90-day-process-overview.md](03-90-day-process-overview.md)**

Industry-agnostic overview of the 90-day engagement structure:
- **Phase 0:** Kickoff
- **Phase 1:** Current-State Discovery
- **Phase 2:** Architecture Mapping
- **Phase 3:** AI Feasibility & Solution Design
- **Phase 4:** Executive Recommendations

**Outcome:** Complete operational blueprint, AI-ready architecture, actionable implementation plan
