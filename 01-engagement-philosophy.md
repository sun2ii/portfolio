# Architecture Philosophy

My approach to enterprise AI focuses on **clarity-first architecture**.

## Process

### 1. Map Current State
Before layering in models or automation, I map:
- Current-state workflows
- Business rules and logic
- Data structures and schemas
- Decision points and bottlenecks

### 2. Design Future State
I design systems that are:
- **Simple** — minimal complexity, essential components only
- **Auditable** — transparent logic, traceable decisions
- **Operationally grounded** — aligned with real-world business needs

### 3. Add AI Strategically
AI components are added only where they:
- Reduce operational friction
- Increase reliability and accuracy
- Eliminate inconsistent decision-making

**Technologies used:**
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Vector embeddings
- Classification models
- Workflow automation

## Outcome

This ensures technical choices align directly with business outcomes — no AI for AI's sake, only where it delivers measurable value.
