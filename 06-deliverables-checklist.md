# Deliverables Checklist

## What You Receive: Complete Discovery & Architecture Package

---

## Phase 0 — Kickoff Deliverables

- **System access inventory** — pricing sheets, catalogs, compliance docs, existing tools
- **Engagement calendar** — meeting cadence, communication channels, weekly milestones

---

## Phase 1 — Discovery Deliverables (Weeks 1-4)

### Stakeholder Interviews
- **Interview summaries** — strategic workflow insights from owner, office staff, estimators, field ops
- **Transcript analysis** — key quotes, pain points, operational friction

### Workflow Documentation
- **Current-state workflow maps** — customer intake → pricing → approval → fulfillment → payment
- **Process diagrams** — visual representation of end-to-end business flow
- **Hand-off analysis** — where data moves between systems or people

### System Inventory
- **Tool & system audit** — spreadsheets, CRMs, messaging platforms, job folders
- **Data asset catalog** — pricing tables, vendor lists, historical invoices, conversation logs
- **Document repository** — compliance PDFs, forms, templates

### Analysis
- **Pain-point summary** — bottlenecks, manual processes, time sinks, error-prone steps
- **Manual-work assessment** — quote creation, material estimation, commission calculation, data entry

---

## Phase 2 — Architecture Deliverables (Weeks 4-8)

### Architecture Diagrams
- **Current-state architecture diagram** — how systems, data, and people interact today
- **Data lineage map** — website → DMs → spreadsheets → field ops flow visualization
- **Integration diagram** — APIs, databases, third-party tools

### Data Model Design
- **Entity-relationship model** — materials, pricing, job costing, customers, contractors
- **Schema documentation** — tables, fields, relationships, constraints
- **Pricing rules engine** — reverse-engineered quoting logic in structured format

### Analysis
- **Bottleneck identification report** — manual classification, pricing inconsistencies, missing structure
- **Data quality assessment** — SKU inconsistencies, vendor catalog gaps, missing metadata
- **Technical debt analysis** — legacy systems, workarounds, fragile dependencies

---

## Phase 3 — AI Feasibility & Solution Design Deliverables (Weeks 8-10)

### AI Opportunity Assessment
- **AI opportunity map** — where automation adds value: intake, classification, pricing validation, job costing
- **RAG feasibility analysis** — materials knowledge base, pricing sheets, compliance docs, conversations
- **Rules vs. LLM decision matrix** — when to use structured logic vs. AI models

### Architecture Design
- **Future-state architecture diagram** — AI-powered system design with embeddings, RAG, and workflows
- **AI component specifications** — user-type detection, intake classification, quoting guidance
- **Embedding strategy document** — how to index pricing tables, materials, vendor catalogs

### Risk & Validation
- **Feasibility stress-test report** — accuracy, cost, reliability, scalability, auditability
- **Risk mitigation plan** — fallback logic, human-in-the-loop, monitoring, compliance
- **Cost/benefit analysis** — implementation costs vs. time savings, error reduction, revenue impact

### Data Model Redesign
- **Proposed data model** — materials, pricing, jobs, user types, conversations
- **Migration strategy** — how to transition from current systems to future state

---

## Phase 4 — Executive Deliverables (Weeks 10-12)

### Strategic Recommendations
- **90-day summary report** — findings, insights, strategic recommendations
- **Executive presentation** — slide deck for leadership with architecture, roadmap, ROI
- **Founder-facing packet** — technical recommendations in business language

### Implementation Roadmap
- **3-phase implementation plan:**
  - **Phase 1** — Knowledge system + onboarding logic
  - **Phase 2** — Pricing engine + job-costing automation
  - **Phase 3** — Full back-office platform + analytics
- **Timeline & milestones** — week-by-week build plan
- **Resource requirements** — team size, tech stack, infrastructure needs
- **Build now vs. later prioritization** — critical path vs. future enhancements

### Business Case
- **Cost/benefit analysis** — investment required vs. operational gains
- **ROI projections** — time saved, accuracy improvements, revenue uplift
- **Risk assessment** — technical risks, mitigation strategies, contingency plans

---

## Bonus Deliverables

- **Knowledge transfer sessions** — architecture walkthrough with your team
- **Technical documentation** — system diagrams, data dictionaries, API specifications
- **Vendor recommendations** — LLM providers, vector databases, cloud infrastructure
- **Post-engagement support plan** — ongoing consultation, implementation assistance

---

## Format

All deliverables provided in:
- **Markdown** — documentation, reports, checklists
- **Mermaid diagrams** — architecture, workflows, data flows
- **Slides** — executive presentations (PDF + editable)
- **Spreadsheets** — cost/benefit, timelines, resource planning (Google Sheets / Excel)
