## Summary

AI Systems Architect with 8+ years experience specializing in enterprise workflow mapping, AI knowledge systems, and operational redesign. I translate complex business processes — onboarding, pricing, commissions, compliance — into clean data models and scalable AI-driven architectures. Experienced in 3-month discovery cycles, stakeholder interviews, legacy system mapping, and delivering executive-ready recommendations and system diagrams. Blend strategic clarity with hands-on implementation across Next.js, Node, PostgreSQL, LangChain, embeddings, RAG, and cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP).
