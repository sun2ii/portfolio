# 90-Day AI Discovery & Architecture Process

## A Structured Approach to Enterprise AI Integration

---

## Overview

This 90-day engagement transforms operational complexity into scalable AI-powered systems. Through structured discovery, architecture mapping, and strategic recommendations, organizations receive a complete blueprint for AI integration—grounded in real workflows, data models, and business logic.

**Outcome:** By Day 90, leadership receives a future-state architecture, implementation roadmap, and executive-ready recommendations.

---

## Phase 0 — Kickoff (Week 0)

**Goal:** Align scope and secure access

**Activities:**
- Confirm project boundaries (underwriting, policy admin, claims, agent onboarding, commission workflows, AI integration points)
- Map stakeholder landscape (underwriting, claims, operations, IT, compliance, finance, leadership)
- Secure system access (policy documents, rating sheets, commission tables, regulatory filings, legacy systems)
- Define engagement rhythm (meeting cadence, communication channels)

**Deliverables:**
- Scope confirmation document
- Stakeholder map
- System access inventory
- Engagement calendar

---

## Phase 1 — Current-State Discovery (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Understand how the insurance business actually operates end-to-end

**Activities:**
- Stakeholder interviews across underwriting, claims, agency management, IT, compliance, finance
- Workflow mapping: quote submission → underwriting → policy issuance → claims processing → commission reconciliation
- Process pain-point and manual-work analysis (data entry, manual reviews, policy amendments, commission disputes)
- Inventory of systems, documents, spreadsheets, business rules, and integrations (policy admin systems, rating engines, agency portals, regulatory filings)

**Deliverables:**
- Current-state workflow diagrams (underwriting, claims, policy admin, agent onboarding)
- Pain-point summary
- Systems + data inventory (policy documents, rating tables, commission structures, compliance docs)

---

## Phase 2 — Architecture Mapping (Weeks 4-8)

**Goal:** Translate insurance operations into clean technical architecture

**Activities:**
- Audit current schemas, data models, and business logic (policy structures, rating algorithms, commission calculations)
- Map integrations, APIs, and data movement (policy admin systems, claims platforms, agency portals, third-party data providers)
- Identify bottlenecks and technical debt (manual underwriting reviews, commission reconciliation errors, duplicate data entry)
- Document rules logic (underwriting guidelines, rating factors, commission tiers, eligibility requirements, regulatory compliance)

**Deliverables:**
- Current-state architecture diagram (policy admin, claims, agency management systems)
- Entity-relationship model (policies, claims, agents, commissions, underwriting decisions)
- Data lineage + integration map (how quote data flows from agent portal → underwriting → policy issuance → billing)

---

## Phase 3 — AI Feasibility & Solution Design (Weeks 8-10)

**Goal:** Identify where AI meaningfully improves insurance workflows

**Activities:**
- Assess RAG suitability + embedding strategy (policy documents, underwriting manuals, regulatory filings, claims guidelines)
- Evaluate rule-based vs. LLM-based logic (rating = rules-based; document classification = LLM-based; fraud detection = hybrid)
- Identify opportunities for classification, intake automation, agent-assist (quote triage, risk assessment, claims document extraction, commission Q&A)
- Validate feasibility across insurance compliance, accuracy, cost, risk, and regulatory requirements

**Deliverables:**
- AI opportunity map (underwriting automation, claims triage, agent onboarding, commission reconciliation, compliance monitoring)
- Future-state architecture diagram (embeddings, RAG, classification, structured workflows)
- Proposed data model redesign (policies, claims, agents, underwriting decisions, audit trails)

---

## Phase 4 — Executive Recommendations (Weeks 10-12)

**Goal:** Deliver a clear, actionable path forward

**Activities:**
- Consolidate findings into exec-facing packet
- Present future-state system, roadmap, and implementation phases
- Provide cost/benefit + risk mitigation plan

**Deliverables:**
- 90-day summary report
- Implementation roadmap (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3)
- Executive presentation

---

## What You Receive

By Day 90, the insurance organization achieves:

- **Complete operational map** — underwriting, claims, policy admin, agent onboarding workflows documented and analyzed
- **Future-state architecture** — designed for AI integration with regulatory compliance built in
- **Prioritized implementation roadmap** — phased, low-risk build plan (underwriting automation → claims triage → agent self-service)
- **Executive recommendations** — clear next steps with ROI justification and risk mitigation

---

## Why This Approach Works for Insurance

**Clarity before automation:** Map underwriting, claims, and commission logic first; automate second
**Operational grounding:** AI components added only where they reduce manual reviews, eliminate commission disputes, or improve risk assessment
**Business alignment:** Technical choices tied directly to measurable outcomes (faster underwriting, lower loss ratios, improved agent satisfaction)
**Risk mitigation:** Phased approach with regulatory compliance checkpoints and explainability requirements

**Insurance-specific advantages:**
- **Auditability:** Every AI decision includes source documentation and reasoning trails
- **Regulatory compliance:** Architecture designed to meet state insurance regulations and internal governance
- **Explainability:** Clear documentation of why underwriting or claims decisions were made
- **Data privacy:** Proper handling of PII, PHI, and sensitive financial information

This process has successfully guided enterprise AI transformations across insurance carriers, MGAs, TPAs, and compliance-heavy regulated industries.
