## Template 1: Initial Outreach (Insurance-Specific)

**Subject:** AI Architecture for [Company] Operations — Discovery & Roadmap

---

Hi [Name],

I'm Ben Basuni, an AI Systems Architect specializing in enterprise workflow mapping and operational redesign for insurance organizations.

I work with companies navigating complex business logic—underwriting workflows, commission structures, policy administration, compliance documentation—and translate those processes into clean, AI-ready architectures.

I've attached a brief overview of my 90-day discovery process and a sample case study showing how I've architected systems for onboarding, pricing logic, and knowledge integration in regulated, document-heavy environments.

**What I deliver:**
- Current-state workflow maps and architecture diagrams
- AI feasibility assessment (where automation adds value vs. where rules-based logic is better)
- Future-state system design with embeddings, RAG, and structured workflows
- Implementation roadmap with phased delivery and risk mitigation

**Why this matters for insurance:**
Insurance operations require auditability, regulatory compliance, and explainability—not just automation. My approach ensures AI components are operationally grounded and designed for long-term scalability.

I'd welcome a 30-minute conversation to discuss how this might apply to [Company]'s operations.

Available this week:
- [Day], [Time]
- [Day], [Time]

Let me know what works.

Best,
Ben Basuni

## Template 2: Follow-Up After Initial Conversation

**Subject:** Re: AI Architecture for [Company] — Next Steps

---

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the conversation earlier. Based on what we discussed, here's what I'd propose:

**Phase 0 — Discovery Kickoff (Week 0)**
- Scope alignment around [specific areas mentioned: underwriting, claims, onboarding, etc.]
- Stakeholder mapping across operations, IT, compliance
- System access to [pricing sheets, policy docs, commission tables, legacy tools]

**Phase 1-2 — Current-State Mapping (Weeks 1-8)**
- Workflow documentation for [specific processes]
- Architecture diagrams showing how data moves today
- Bottleneck analysis and technical debt assessment

**Phase 3-4 — AI Strategy & Recommendations (Weeks 8-12)**
- AI opportunity map (where automation adds value)
- Future-state architecture with embeddings, RAG, classification
- Implementation roadmap with cost/benefit and risk mitigation

**Deliverables:**
- Executive presentation with findings and recommendations
- Architecture diagrams and data models
- Phased implementation plan

I've attached a detailed deliverables checklist so you can see exactly what you'd receive.

Let me know if you'd like to proceed with a scoping conversation or if you need additional context.

Best,

## Template 3: Cold Outreach (General)

**Subject:** Enterprise AI Architecture — Workflow Mapping & System Design

---

Hi [Name],

I specialize in translating complex business operations—onboarding, pricing logic, commission structures, compliance workflows—into scalable AI-driven architectures.

My background includes 8+ years building enterprise systems across contractors, infrastructure operations, and regulated industries. I work with organizations to:

1. Map current-state workflows and data models
2. Design future-state AI architectures (embeddings, RAG, classification)
3. Deliver implementation roadmaps with phased delivery and risk mitigation

I've attached a sample 90-day process overview and case study showing how I've architected AI knowledge systems for operational redesign.

If you're evaluating how AI could improve [underwriting / claims / onboarding / policy admin], I'd welcome a brief conversation.

Available this week for a 30-minute call.

Best,
Ben Basuni

## Template 4: Post-Engagement Follow-Up

**Subject:** [Company] AI Architecture Engagement — Summary & Next Steps

---

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the opportunity to work with [Company] over the past 90 days. Here's a summary of what we accomplished:

**Deliverables:**
- Current-state workflow diagrams for [processes mapped]
- Architecture diagrams showing data lineage and system integrations
- AI opportunity assessment with feasibility analysis
- Future-state architecture design with embeddings, RAG, and structured workflows
- Implementation roadmap with 3-phase delivery plan

**Key Findings:**
- [Insight 1 about bottlenecks or opportunities]
- [Insight 2 about AI suitability]
- [Insight 3 about technical debt or data quality]

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. [Phase 1 implementation: knowledge system + onboarding logic]
2. [Phase 2 implementation: pricing engine + automation]
3. [Phase 3 implementation: full platform + analytics]

I'm available for ongoing consultation as you move into implementation. Let me know how I can support the next phase.

Best,
Ben Basuni

## Email Best Practices

**Subject Line Guidelines:**
- Keep under 60 characters
- Include company name when possible
- Be specific about value (e.g., "AI Architecture for Claims Processing")

**Body Structure:**
1. Who you are (1 sentence)
2. What you do (2-3 sentences)
3. Why it matters for them (1-2 sentences)
4. What you're offering (attachment or conversation)
5. Clear call to action (meeting availability)

**Attachments:**
- Keep to 2-3 PDFs max
- Lead with: 90-Day Process Overview, Deliverables Checklist
- Add case study only if highly relevant

**Follow-Up Timing:**
- First follow-up: 3-4 business days
- Second follow-up: 1 week after first
- Third follow-up: 2 weeks after second (final)

**Tone:**
- Professional but not stiff
- Confident but not arrogant
- Specific > vague
- Outcome-focused > process-focused
